    "[Terrier](http://terrier.org) is an open-source information retrieval platform aimed at reserach and experimentation. We'll use [PyTerrier](https://pyterrier.readthedocs.io/), which provides a Python API for Terrier, in this lecture. This series of notebooks gives a brief introduction to PyTerrier.\n",
